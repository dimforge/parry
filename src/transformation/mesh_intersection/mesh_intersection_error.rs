/// producing a new mesh that represents their overlapping volume. This operation requires both
/// input meshes to have certain properties and can fail for various reasons.

/// Both input meshes must have:
/// 1. **Topology information**: Half-edge data structure for adjacency information
/// 2. **Pseudo-normals**: For robust inside/outside testing
///
/// These are enabled by setting the [`TriMeshFlags::ORIENTED`] flag when creating the mesh.

/// Geometric description of a contact between two shapes.
///
/// A contact represents the point(s) where two shapes touch or penetrate. This structure
/// contains all the information needed to resolve collisions: contact points, surface normals,
/// and penetration depth.
///
/// # Contact States
///
/// A `Contact` can represent different collision states:
///
/// - **Touching** (`dist â‰ˆ 0.0`): Shapes are just barely in contact
/// - **Penetrating** (`dist < 0.0`): Shapes are overlapping (negative distance = penetration depth)
/// - **Separated** (`dist > 0.0`): Shapes are close but not touching (rarely used; see `closest_points` instead)
///
/// # Coordinate Systems
///
/// Contact data can be expressed in different coordinate systems:
///
/// - **World space**: Both shapes' transformations applied; `normal2 = -normal1`
/// - **Local space**: Relative to one shape's coordinate system
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - **Physics simulation**: Compute collision response forces
/// - **Collision resolution**: Push objects apart when penetrating
/// - **Trigger detection**: Detect when objects touch without resolving
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))] {
/// use parry3d::query::contact;
/// use parry3d::shape::Ball;
/// use nalgebra::{Isometry3, Vector3};
///
/// let ball1 = Ball::new(1.0);
/// let ball2 = Ball::new(1.0);
///
/// // Overlapping balls (centers 1.5 units apart, combined radii = 2.0)
/// let pos1 = Isometry3::translation(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
/// let pos2 = Isometry3::translation(1.5, 0.0, 0.0);
///
/// if let Ok(Some(contact)) = contact(&pos1, &ball1, &pos2, &ball2, 0.0) {
///     // Penetration depth (negative distance)
///     assert!(contact.dist < 0.0);
///     println!("Penetration: {}", -contact.dist); // 0.5 units
///
///     // Normal points from shape 1 toward shape 2
///     println!("Normal: {:?}", contact.normal1);
///
///     // Contact points are on each shape's surface
///     println!("Point on ball1: {:?}", contact.point1);
///     println!("Point on ball2: {:?}", contact.point2);
/// }
/// # }

//! The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi distance algorithm.
//!
//! # What is GJK?
//!
//! The **Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK)** algorithm is a fundamental geometric algorithm used
//! to compute the distance between two convex shapes. It's one of the most important algorithms
//! in collision detection and is used extensively in physics engines, robotics, and computer graphics.
//!
//! ## How GJK Works (Simplified)
//!
//! GJK works by operating on the **Minkowski difference** (also called Configuration Space Obstacle or CSO)
//! of two shapes. Instead of directly comparing the shapes, GJK:
//!
//! 1. Constructs a simplex (triangle in 2D, tetrahedron in 3D) within the Minkowski difference
//! 2. Iteratively refines this simplex to find the point closest to the origin
//! 3. The distance from the origin to this closest point equals the distance between the shapes
//!
//! If the origin is **inside** the Minkowski difference, the shapes are intersecting.
//! If the origin is **outside**, the distance to the closest point gives the separation distance.
//!
//! ## When is GJK Used?
//!
//! GJK is used whenever you need to:
//! - **Check if two convex shapes intersect** (collision detection)
//! - **Find the minimum distance** between two convex shapes
//! - **Compute closest points** on two shapes
//! - **Cast a shape along a direction** to find the time of impact (continuous collision detection)
//!
//! ## Key Advantages of GJK
//!
//! - Works with **any convex shape** that can provide a support function
//! - Does **not require the full geometry** of the shapes (only support points)
//! - Very **fast convergence** in most practical cases
//! - Forms the basis for many collision detection systems
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! - Only works with **convex shapes** (use convex decomposition for concave shapes)
//! - When shapes are penetrating, GJK can only detect intersection but not penetration depth
//!   (use EPA - Expanding Polytope Algorithm - for penetration depth)
//!
//! # Main Functions in This Module
//!
//! - [`closest_points`] - The core GJK algorithm for finding distance and closest points
//! - [`project_origin`] - Projects the origin onto a shape's boundary
//! - [`cast_local_ray`] - Casts a ray against a shape (used for raycasting)
//! - [`directional_distance`] - Computes how far a shape can move before touching another
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! See individual function documentation for usage examples.

///
/// # Understanding the Results
///
/// - **Intersection**: The shapes are overlapping. The origin lies inside the Minkowski difference.
/// - **ClosestPoints**: The exact closest points on both shapes were computed, along with the
///   separation direction.
/// - **Proximity**: The shapes are close but not intersecting. Only an approximate separation
///   direction is provided (used when exact distance computation is not needed).
/// - **NoIntersection**: The shapes are too far apart (beyond the specified `max_dist` threshold).
///
/// # Coordinate Spaces
///
/// All points and vectors in this result are expressed in the **local-space of the first shape**
/// (the shape passed as `g1` to the GJK functions). This is important when working with
/// transformed shapes.

 * Separating Axis GJK
 */
/// Computes the closest points between two shapes using the GJK algorithm.
///
/// This is the **core function** of the GJK implementation in Parry. It can compute:
/// - Whether two shapes are intersecting
/// - The distance between two separated shapes
/// - The closest points on both shapes
/// - An approximate separation axis when exact distance isn't needed
///
/// # How It Works
///
/// The algorithm operates on the Minkowski difference (CSO) of the two shapes and iteratively
/// builds a simplex that approximates the point closest to the origin. The algorithm terminates
/// when:
/// - The shapes are proven to intersect (origin is inside the CSO)
/// - The minimum distance is found within the tolerance
/// - The shapes are proven to be farther than `max_dist` apart
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `pos12`: The relative position of shape 2 with respect to shape 1. This is the isometry
///   that transforms from shape 1's space to shape 2's space.
/// - `g1`: The first shape (must implement `SupportMap`)
/// - `g2`: The second shape (must implement `SupportMap`)
/// - `max_dist`: Maximum distance to check. If shapes are farther than this, the algorithm
///   returns `GJKResult::NoIntersection` early. Use `Real::max_value()` to disable this check.
/// - `exact_dist`: Whether to compute exact closest points:
///   - `true`: Computes exact distance and returns `GJKResult::ClosestPoints`
///   - `false`: May return `GJKResult::Proximity` with only an approximate separation axis,
///     which is faster when you only need to know if shapes are nearby
/// - `simplex`: A reusable simplex structure. Initialize with `VoronoiSimplex::new()` before
///   first use. Can be reused across calls for better performance.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns a [`GJKResult`] which can be:
/// - `Intersection`: The shapes are overlapping
/// - `ClosestPoints(p1, p2, normal)`: The closest points on each shape (when `exact_dist` is true)
/// - `Proximity(axis)`: An approximate separation axis (when `exact_dist` is false)
/// - `NoIntersection(axis)`: The shapes are farther than `max_dist` apart

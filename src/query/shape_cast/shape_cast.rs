/// Computes when two moving shapes will collide (shape casting / swept collision detection).

/// (CCD) to prevent fast-moving objects from tunneling through each other.
///
/// # What is Shape Casting?
///
/// Shape casting extends ray casting to arbitrary shapes:
/// - **Ray casting**: Point moving in a direction (infinitely thin)
/// - **Shape casting**: Full shape moving in a direction (has volume)
///
/// The shapes move linearly (no rotation) from their initial positions along their
/// velocities until they touch or the time limit is reached.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - **Will collide**: Returns `Some(hit)` with time of first impact
/// - **Already touching**: Returns `Some(hit)` with `time_of_impact = 0.0`
/// - **Won't collide**: Returns `None` (no impact within time range)
/// - **Moving apart**: May return `None` depending on `stop_at_penetration` option
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `pos1` - Initial position and orientation of the first shape
/// * `vel1` - Linear velocity of the first shape (units per time)
/// * `g1` - The first shape
/// * `pos2` - Initial position and orientation of the second shape
/// * `vel2` - Linear velocity of the second shape
/// * `g2` - The second shape
/// * `options` - Configuration options (max time, target distance, etc.)
///
/// # Options
///
/// Configure behavior with [`ShapeCastOptions`]:
/// - `max_time_of_impact`: Maximum time to check (ignore later impacts)
/// - `target_distance`: Consider "close enough" when within this distance
/// - `stop_at_penetration`: Stop if initially penetrating and moving apart
/// - `compute_impact_geometry_on_penetration`: Compute reliable witnesses at t=0
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(Some(hit))` - Impact found, see [`ShapeCastHit`] for details
/// * `Ok(None)` - No impact within time range
/// * `Err(Unsupported)` - This shape pair is not supported
///

///     // Ball 1 moved 8 units to x=8.0, touching ball 2 at x=10.0
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Example: Already Penetrating

///     assert_eq!(hit.status, ShapeCastStatus::PenetratingOrWithinTargetDist);
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - **Continuous collision detection**: Prevent tunneling at high speeds

///
/// Shape casting is more expensive than static queries:

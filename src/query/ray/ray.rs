/// A ray for ray-casting queries.
///
/// A ray is a half-infinite line starting at an origin point and extending
/// infinitely in a direction. Rays are fundamental for visibility queries,
/// shooting mechanics, and collision prediction.
///
/// # Structure
///
/// - **origin**: The starting point of the ray
/// - **dir**: The direction vector (does NOT need to be normalized)
///
/// # Direction Vector
///
/// The direction can be any non-zero vector:
/// - **Normalized**: `dir` with length 1.0 gives time-of-impact in world units
/// - **Not normalized**: Time-of-impact is scaled by `dir.norm()`
///
/// Most applications use normalized directions for intuitive results.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - **Shooting/bullets**: Check what a projectile hits
/// - **Line of sight**: Check if one object can "see" another
/// - **Mouse picking**: Select objects by clicking
/// - **Laser beams**: Simulate light or laser paths
/// - **Proximity sensing**: Detect obstacles in a direction
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))]
/// use parry3d::query::{Ray, RayCast};
/// use parry3d::shape::Ball;
/// use nalgebra::{Point3, Vector3, Isometry3};
///
/// // Create a ray from origin pointing along +X axis
/// let ray = Ray::new(
///     Point3::origin(),
///     Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)  // Normalized direction
/// );
///
/// // Create a ball at position (5, 0, 0) with radius 1
/// let ball = Ball::new(1.0);
/// let ball_pos = Isometry3::translation(5.0, 0.0, 0.0);
///
/// // Cast the ray against the ball
/// if let Some(toi) = ball.cast_ray(&ball_pos, &ray, 100.0, true) {
///     // Ray hits at t=4.0 (center at 5.0 minus radius 1.0)
///     assert_eq!(toi, 4.0);
///
///     // Compute the actual hit point
///     let hit_point = ray.point_at(toi);
///     assert_eq!(hit_point, Point3::new(4.0, 0.0, 0.0));

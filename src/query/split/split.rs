/// The result of a plane-splitting operation.
///
/// This enum represents the three possible outcomes when splitting a geometric shape with a plane.
/// It efficiently handles all cases without unnecessary allocations when the shape doesn't need
/// to be split.
///
/// # Type Parameter
///
/// The generic type `T` represents the shape being split. Common types include:
/// - [`Aabb`](crate::bounding_volume::Aabb) - Axis-aligned bounding box
/// - [`Segment`](crate::shape::Segment) - Line segment
/// - [`TriMesh`](crate::shape::TriMesh) - Triangle mesh
///
/// # Half-Space Definition
///
/// Given a plane defined by a normal vector `n` and bias `b`, a point `p` lies in:
/// - **Negative half-space** if `n · p < b` (behind the plane)
/// - **Positive half-space** if `n · p > b` (in front of the plane)
/// - **On the plane** if `n · p ≈ b` (within epsilon tolerance)

/// Plane-intersection operations are useful for:

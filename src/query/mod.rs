//! Non-persistent geometric queries.
//!
//! # General cases
//! The most general methods provided by this module are:
//!
//! * [`closest_points()`] to compute the closest points between two shapes.
//! * [`distance()`] to compute the distance between two shapes.
//! * [`contact()`] to compute one pair of contact points between two shapes, including penetrating contact.
//! * [`intersection_test()`] to determine if two shapes are intersecting or not.
//! * [`time_of_impact()`] to determine when two shapes undergoing translational motions hit for the first time.
//! * [`nonlinear_time_of_impact()`] to determine when two shapes undergoing continuous rigid motions hit for the first time.
//!
//! Ray-casting and point-projection can be achieved by importing traits:
//!
//! * [`RayCast`] for ray-casting.
//! * [`PointQuery`] for point projection.
//!
//! # Specific cases
//! The functions exported by the `details` submodule are more specific versions of the ones described above.
//! For example `distance_ball_ball` computes the distance between two shapes known at compile-time to be balls.
//! They are less convenient to use than the most generic version but will be slightly faster due to the lack of dynamic dispatch.
//! The specific functions have the form `[operation]_[shape1]_[shape2]()` where:
//!
//! * `[operation]` can be `closest_points`, `distance`, `contact`, `intersection_test` or `time_of_impact`.
//! * `[shape1]` is the type of the first shape passed to the function, e.g., `ball`, or `halfspace`. Can also identify a trait implemented by supported shapes, e.g., `support_map`.
//! * `[shape2]` is the type of the second shape passed to the function, e.g., `ball`, or `halfspace`. Can also identify a trait implemented by supported shapes, e.g., `support_map`.

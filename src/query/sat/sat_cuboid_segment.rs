/// Finds the best separating axis by testing edge-edge combinations between a cuboid and a segment (3D only).
///
/// In 3D, when a box collides with a line segment, the contact might occur along an axis
/// perpendicular to both a cuboid edge and the segment itself. This function tests all such
/// axes (cross products) to find the one with maximum separation.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `cube1`: The cuboid
/// - `segment2`: The line segment
/// - `pos12`: The position of the segment relative to the cuboid
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A tuple containing:
/// - `Real`: The maximum separation found across all edge-edge axes
///   - **Positive**: Shapes are separated
///   - **Negative**: Shapes are overlapping
/// - `Vector<Real>`: The axis direction that gives this separation
///
/// # The 3 Axes Tested
///
/// A segment is a single edge, so we test cross products between:
/// - The segment's direction (B - A)
/// - Each of the 3 cuboid edge directions (X, Y, Z)
///
/// This gives 3 potential separating axes. The function delegates to
/// [`cuboid_support_map_find_local_separating_edge_twoway`](super::cuboid_support_map_find_local_separating_edge_twoway)
/// to perform the actual separation tests.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))]
/// # {
/// use parry3d::shape::{Cuboid, Segment};
/// use parry3d::query::sat::cuboid_segment_find_local_separating_edge_twoway;
/// use nalgebra::{Point3, Vector3, Isometry3};
///
/// let cube = Cuboid::new(Vector3::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
/// let segment = Segment::new(
///     Point3::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
///     Point3::new(0.0, 2.0, 0.0)
/// );
///
/// // Position segment to the right of the cube
/// let pos12 = Isometry3::translation(2.5, 0.0, 0.0);
///
/// let (separation, axis) = cuboid_segment_find_local_separating_edge_twoway(
///     &cube,
///     &segment,
///     &pos12
/// );
///
/// println!("Edge-edge separation: {}", separation);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Usage in Complete SAT
///
/// For a complete cuboid-segment collision test, you must also test:
/// 1. Cuboid face normals (X, Y, Z axes)
/// 2. Segment normal (in 2D) or face normal (for degenerate 3D cases)
/// 3. Edge-edge axes (this function, 3D only)

/// Computes when two shapes moving with translation and rotation will first collide.
///
/// This function performs **nonlinear shape casting** - finding the time of impact (TOI) for
/// two shapes that are both translating and rotating. Unlike linear shape casting which only
/// handles straight-line motion, this accounts for the curved trajectories created by rotation.
///
/// # What This Function Does
///
/// Given two shapes with complete rigid body motion (position, linear velocity, and angular
/// velocity), this function finds:
/// - **When** they will first touch (time of impact)
/// - **Where** they touch (witness points)
/// - **How** they touch (contact normals)
///
/// The function solves a complex nonlinear root-finding problem to determine the exact moment
/// when the shapes' minimum distance reaches zero (or a target threshold).
///
/// # How It Differs from Linear Shape Casting
///
/// | Feature | Linear (`cast_shapes`) | Nonlinear (`cast_shapes_nonlinear`) |
/// |---------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
/// | **Motion type** | Translation only | Translation + rotation |
/// | **Trajectory** | Straight line | Curved (helical path) |
/// | **Input** | Position + velocity | Full rigid motion (position + velocities + angular vel) |
/// | **Use case** | Sliding, sweeping | Spinning, tumbling, realistic physics |
/// | **Performance** | Faster | Slower (more complex) |
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `motion1` - Complete motion description for shape 1 ([`NonlinearRigidMotion`])
///   - Starting position and orientation
///   - Linear velocity (translation)
///   - Angular velocity (rotation)
///   - Local center of rotation
/// * `g1` - The first shape geometry
/// * `motion2` - Complete motion description for shape 2
/// * `g2` - The second shape geometry
/// * `start_time` - Beginning of time interval to check (typically `0.0`)
/// * `end_time` - End of time interval to check (e.g., your physics timestep)
/// * `stop_at_penetration` - Controls behavior when shapes start penetrating:
///   - `true`: Returns immediately with `time_of_impact = start_time`
///   - `false`: Checks if they're separating; if so, looks for later impacts
///
/// # The `stop_at_penetration` Parameter
///
/// This parameter is crucial for handling initially-penetrating shapes:
///
/// - **`true` (recommended for most cases)**: If shapes overlap at `start_time`, immediately
///   return a hit at `start_time`. This is safer and prevents tunneling.
///
/// - **`false` (advanced)**: If shapes overlap at `start_time` BUT are moving apart (separating
///   velocity), ignore this initial penetration and search for a later collision that could
///   cause tunneling. Use this when you have external penetration resolution and only care
///   about future impacts.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(Some(hit))` - Collision detected, see [`ShapeCastHit`] for impact details
///   - `time_of_impact`: When collision occurs (in `[start_time, end_time]`)
///   - `witness1`, `witness2`: Contact points on each shape (local space)
///   - `normal1`, `normal2`: Contact normals on each shape (local space)
///   - `status`: Algorithm convergence status
/// * `Ok(None)` - No collision within the time interval
/// * `Err(Unsupported)` - This shape pair is not supported for nonlinear casting
///

///
/// # When to Use This vs Linear Shape Casting
///
/// **Use `cast_shapes_nonlinear` when:**
/// - Objects have significant angular velocity
/// - Rotation accuracy matters (spinning blades, tumbling debris)
/// - Physics simulation with full 6-DOF motion
/// - Objects can rotate > 10-15 degrees during timestep
///
/// **Use `cast_shapes` (linear) when:**
/// - Objects don't rotate (angular velocity â‰ˆ 0)
/// - Rotation is negligible for your timestep
/// - Performance is critical
/// - Implementing simple sweep/slide mechanics
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Nonlinear shape casting is significantly more expensive than linear:
/// - **Iterative root-finding**: Multiple evaluations to converge
/// - **Rotational transforms**: Matrix operations at each evaluation
/// - **Complex geometry**: Shape changes orientation during motion
///
/// Typical cost: 3-10x slower than linear shape casting, depending on:
/// - Shape complexity (balls faster than meshes)
/// - Angular velocity magnitude (faster rotation = more iterations)
/// - Time interval length (longer intervals may need more precision)
///
/// # Algorithm Notes
///
/// The implementation uses conservative root-finding algorithms that:
/// - Guarantee no false negatives (won't miss collisions)
/// - May require multiple iterations to converge
/// - Handle degenerate cases (parallel surfaces, grazing contact)
/// - Account for numerical precision limits
///
/// # Common Pitfalls
///
/// 1. **Units**: Ensure time, velocity, and angular velocity units match
///    - If time is in seconds, velocity should be units/second
///    - Angular velocity in radians/second (not degrees!)
///
/// 2. **Time interval**: Keep `end_time - start_time` reasonable
///    - Very large intervals may miss fast rotations
///    - Typical: use your physics timestep (e.g., 1/60 second)
///
/// 3. **Rotation center**: `local_center` in [`NonlinearRigidMotion`] must be in
///    the shape's local coordinate system, not world space
///
/// 4. **Initial penetration**: Understand `stop_at_penetration` behavior for your use case
///

/// The result of projecting a point onto a shape.
///
/// Point projection finds the closest point on a shape's surface to a given query point.
/// This is fundamental for many geometric queries including distance calculation,
/// collision detection, and surface sampling.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - **is_inside**: Whether the query point is inside the shape
/// - **point**: The closest point on the shape's surface
///
/// # Inside vs Outside
///
/// The `is_inside` flag indicates the query point's location relative to the shape:
/// - `true`: Query point is inside the shape (projection is on boundary)
/// - `false`: Query point is outside the shape (projection is nearest surface point)
///
/// # Solid Parameter
///
/// Most projection functions take a `solid` parameter:
/// - `solid = true`: Shape is treated as solid (filled interior)
/// - `solid = false`: Shape is treated as hollow (surface only)
///
/// This affects `is_inside` calculation for points in the interior.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))] {
/// use parry3d::query::PointQuery;
/// use parry3d::shape::Ball;
/// use nalgebra::{Point3, Isometry3};
///
/// let ball = Ball::new(5.0);
/// let ball_pos = Isometry3::translation(10.0, 0.0, 0.0);
///
/// // Project a point outside the ball
/// let outside_point = Point3::origin();
/// let proj = ball.project_point(&ball_pos, &outside_point, true);
///
/// // Closest point on ball surface
/// assert_eq!(proj.point, Point3::new(5.0, 0.0, 0.0));
/// assert!(!proj.is_inside);
///
/// // Project a point inside the ball
/// let inside_point = Point3::new(10.0, 0.0, 0.0); // At center
/// let proj2 = ball.project_point(&ball_pos, &inside_point, true);

/// Trait for shapes that support point projection and containment queries.
///
/// This trait provides methods to:
/// - Project points onto the shape's surface
/// - Calculate distance from a point to the shape
/// - Test if a point is inside the shape
///
/// All major shapes implement this trait, making it easy to perform point queries
/// on any collision shape.
///
/// # Methods Overview
///
/// - **Projection**: `project_point()`, `project_local_point()`
/// - **Distance**: `distance_to_point()`, `distance_to_local_point()`
/// - **Containment**: `contains_point()`, `contains_local_point()`
///
/// # Local vs World Space
///
/// Methods with `local_` prefix work in the shape's local coordinate system:
/// - **Local methods**: Point must be in shape's coordinate frame
/// - **World methods**: Point in world space, shape transformation applied
///
/// # Solid Parameter
///
/// The `solid` parameter affects how interior points are handled:
/// - `solid = true`: Shape is filled (has interior volume/area)
/// - `solid = false`: Shape is hollow (surface only, no interior)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))] {
/// use parry3d::query::PointQuery;
/// use parry3d::shape::Cuboid;
/// use nalgebra::{Point3, Vector3, Isometry3};

/// A reference-counted, shareable geometric shape.
///
/// `SharedShape` is a wrapper around [`Arc<dyn Shape>`] that allows multiple parts of your
/// code to share ownership of the same shape without copying it. This is particularly useful
/// when the same geometric shape is used by multiple colliders or when you want to avoid
/// the memory overhead of duplicating complex shapes like triangle meshes.
///
/// # Why use SharedShape?
///
/// - **Memory efficiency**: Share expensive shapes (like [`TriMesh`] or [`HeightField`]) across multiple colliders
/// - **Performance**: Cloning a `SharedShape` only increments a reference count, not the shape data
/// - **Type erasure**: Store different shape types uniformly via the [`Shape`] trait
/// - **Flexibility**: Can be converted to a unique instance via [`make_mut`](Self::make_mut) when needed
///
/// # When to use SharedShape?
///
/// Use `SharedShape` when:
/// - You need multiple colliders with the same geometry
/// - You're working with large, complex shapes (meshes, compounds, heightfields)
/// - You want to store heterogeneous shape types in a collection
///
/// Use concrete shape types directly when:
/// - You have a single, simple shape that won't be shared
/// - You need direct access to shape-specific methods
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Creating and sharing a ball shape:
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))] {
/// # use parry3d::shape::SharedShape;
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim2", feature = "f32"))] {
/// # use parry2d::shape::SharedShape;
///
/// // Create a ball with radius 1.0
/// let shape = SharedShape::ball(1.0);
///
/// // Clone it cheaply - only the Arc is cloned, not the shape data
/// let shape_clone = shape.clone();
///
/// // Both shapes reference the same underlying ball
/// assert_eq!(shape.as_ball().unwrap().radius, 1.0);
/// assert_eq!(shape_clone.as_ball().unwrap().radius, 1.0);

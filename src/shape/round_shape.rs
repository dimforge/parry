/// A shape with rounded borders.
///
/// # What is a Rounded Shape?
///
/// A `RoundShape` wraps an existing shape and adds a "border radius" around it. This creates
/// a smooth, rounded version of the original shape by effectively expanding it outward by
/// the border radius distance. Think of it as adding padding or a cushion around the shape.
///
/// The rounding is achieved by using Minkowski sum operations: any point on the surface of
/// the rounded shape is computed by taking a point on the original shape's surface and moving
/// it outward along the surface normal by the border radius distance.
///
/// # Common Use Cases
///
/// - **Creating softer collisions**: Rounded shapes can make collision detection more forgiving
///   and realistic, as sharp corners and edges are smoothed out.
/// - **Capsule-like shapes**: You can create capsule variations of any shape by adding a
///   border radius (e.g., a rounded cuboid becomes similar to a capsule).
/// - **Visual aesthetics**: Rounded shapes often look more pleasing and natural than sharp-edged
///   shapes.
/// - **Improved numerical stability**: Rounded shapes can sometimes be more numerically stable
///   in collision detection algorithms since they avoid sharp corners.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Creating a Rounded Cuboid
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))]
/// # {
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
/// use parry3d::shape::{RoundShape, Cuboid};
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f64")]
/// use parry3d_f64::shape::{RoundShape, Cuboid};
/// use nalgebra::Vector3;
///
/// // Create a cuboid with half-extents of 1.0 in each direction
/// let cuboid = Cuboid::new(Vector3::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
///
/// // Add a border radius of 0.2 to create a rounded cuboid
/// let rounded_cuboid = RoundShape {
///     inner_shape: cuboid,
///     border_radius: 0.2,
/// };
///
/// // The effective size is now 1.2 in each direction from the center
/// // (1.0 from the cuboid + 0.2 from the border)
/// assert_eq!(rounded_cuboid.inner_shape.half_extents.x, 1.0);
/// assert_eq!(rounded_cuboid.border_radius, 0.2);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Creating a Rounded Triangle (2D)
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim2", feature = "f32"))]
/// # {
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
/// use parry2d::shape::{RoundShape, Triangle};
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f64")]
/// use parry2d_f64::shape::{RoundShape, Triangle};
/// use nalgebra::Point2;
///
/// // Create a triangle
/// let triangle = Triangle::new(
///     Point2::origin(),
///     Point2::new(1.0, 0.0),
///     Point2::new(0.0, 1.0),
/// );
///
/// // Add rounding with a 0.1 border radius
/// let rounded_triangle = RoundShape {
///     inner_shape: triangle,
///     border_radius: 0.1,
/// };
///
/// // The rounded triangle will have smooth, curved edges instead of sharp corners
/// assert_eq!(rounded_triangle.border_radius, 0.1);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Comparing Support Points
///
/// This example shows how the border radius affects the support point calculation:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))]
/// # {
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
/// use parry3d::shape::{RoundShape, Cuboid, SupportMap};
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f64")]
/// use parry3d_f64::shape::{RoundShape, Cuboid, SupportMap};
/// use nalgebra::Vector3;
///
/// let cuboid = Cuboid::new(Vector3::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
/// let rounded_cuboid = RoundShape {
///     inner_shape: cuboid,
///     border_radius: 0.5,
/// };
///
/// // Query the support point in the direction (1, 1, 1)
/// let direction = Vector3::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
/// let support_point = rounded_cuboid.local_support_point(&direction);
///
/// // The support point will be further out than the original cuboid's support point
/// // due to the border radius
/// let cuboid_support = cuboid.local_support_point(&direction);
///
/// // The rounded shape extends further in all directions
/// assert!(support_point.x > cuboid_support.x);
/// assert!(support_point.y > cuboid_support.y);
/// assert!(support_point.z > cuboid_support.z);
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Using with Different Shape Types
///
/// `RoundShape` can wrap any shape that implements the `SupportMap` trait:
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[cfg(all(feature = "dim3", feature = "f32"))]
/// # {
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
/// use parry3d::shape::{RoundShape, Ball, Segment, SupportMap};
/// # #[cfg(feature = "f64")]
/// use parry3d_f64::shape::{RoundShape, Ball, Segment, SupportMap};
/// use nalgebra::{Point3, Vector3};
///
/// // Rounded ball (creates a slightly larger sphere)
/// let ball = Ball::new(1.0);
/// let rounded_ball = RoundShape {
///     inner_shape: ball,
///     border_radius: 0.1,
/// };
/// // Effective radius is now 1.1
///
/// // Rounded segment (creates a capsule)
/// let segment = Segment::new(
///     Point3::origin(),
///     Point3::new(0.0, 2.0, 0.0),
/// );
/// let rounded_segment = RoundShape {
///     inner_shape: segment,
///     border_radius: 0.5,
/// };
/// // This creates a capsule with radius 0.5
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// - The computational cost of queries on a `RoundShape` is essentially the same as for the
///   inner shape, plus a small constant overhead to apply the border radius.
/// - `RoundShape` is most efficient when used with shapes that already implement `SupportMap`
///   efficiently (like primitives: Ball, Cuboid, Capsule, etc.).
/// - The struct is `Copy` when the inner shape is `Copy`, making it efficient to pass around.
///
/// # Technical Details
///
/// The `RoundShape` implements the `SupportMap` trait by computing the support point of the
/// inner shape and then offsetting it by the border radius in the query direction. This is
/// mathematically equivalent to computing the Minkowski sum of the inner shape with a ball
/// of radius equal to the border radius.
pub struct RoundShape<S> {
    /// The shape being rounded.
    ///

    /// this inner shape's surface.

    /// surface will be moved 0.5 units outward along its surface normal.

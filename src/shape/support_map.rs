//! Traits for support mapping based shapes.
//!
//! # What is a Support Map?
//!
//! A **support map** (or support function) is a fundamental concept in computational geometry that
//! describes a convex shape by answering a simple question: "What point on the shape is furthest
//! in a given direction?"
//!
//! More formally, for a convex shape `S` and a direction vector `d`, the support function returns:
//!
//! ```text
//! support(S, d) = argmax { p · d : p ∈ S }
//! ```
//!
//! Where `p · d` is the dot product between a point `p` on the shape and the direction `d`.
//!
//! ## Visual Intuition
//!
//! Imagine shining a light from infinity in direction `d` onto your shape. The support point
//! is where the "shadow" boundary would be - the point that sticks out furthest in that direction.
//!
//! For example, for a circle centered at the origin with radius `r`:
//! - If `d = (1, 0)` (pointing right), the support point is `(r, 0)` (rightmost point)
//! - If `d = (0, 1)` (pointing up), the support point is `(0, r)` (topmost point)
//! - If `d = (1, 1)` (diagonal), the support point is `(r/√2, r/√2)` (northeast point)
//!
//! ## Why Support Maps Matter for Collision Detection
//!
//! Support maps are the foundation of two powerful collision detection algorithms:
//!
//! ### 1. GJK Algorithm (Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi)
//!
//! GJK is an iterative algorithm that determines:
//! - Whether two convex shapes intersect
//! - The distance between two separated shapes
//! - The closest points between two shapes
//!
//! GJK works by computing the **Minkowski difference** of two shapes using only their support
//! functions. It builds a simplex (a simple polytope) that converges toward the origin, allowing
//! it to answer collision queries without ever explicitly computing the shapes' geometry.
//!
//! **Key advantage**: GJK only needs the support function - it never needs to know the actual
//! vertices, faces, or internal structure of the shapes. This makes it incredibly flexible and
//! efficient.
//!
//! ### 2. EPA Algorithm (Expanding Polytope Algorithm)
//!
//! EPA is used when two shapes are penetrating (overlapping). It computes:
//! - The penetration depth (how much they overlap)
//! - The penetration normal (the direction to separate them)
//! - Contact points for physics simulation
//!
//! EPA starts with the final simplex from GJK and expands it into a polytope that approximates
//! the Minkowski difference, converging toward the shallowest penetration.
//!
//! ## Why Support Maps are Efficient
//!
//! 1. **Simple to implement**: For most convex shapes, the support function is straightforward
//! 2. **No geometry storage**: Implicit shapes (like spheres, capsules) don't need vertex data
//! 3. **Transform-friendly**: Easy to handle rotations and translations
//! 4. **Composable**: Can combine support functions for compound shapes
//! 5. **Fast queries**: Often just a few dot products and comparisons
//!
//! ## Examples of Support Functions
//!
//! Here are some common shapes and their support functions:
//!
//! ### Sphere/Ball
//! ```text
//! support(sphere, d) = center + normalize(d) * radius
//! ```
//!
//! ### Cuboid (Box)
//! ```text
//! support(box, d) = (sign(d.x) * half_width,
//!                    sign(d.y) * half_height,
//!                    sign(d.z) * half_depth)
//! ```
//!
//! ### Convex Polygon/Polyhedron
//! ```text
//! support(poly, d) = vertex with maximum dot product with d
//! ```
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! Support maps only work for **convex** shapes. Concave shapes must be decomposed into
//! convex parts or handled with different algorithms. This is why Parry provides composite
//! shapes and specialized algorithms for triangle meshes.

/// Trait for convex shapes representable by a support mapping function.
///
/// A support map is a function that returns the point on a shape that is furthest in a given
/// direction. This is the fundamental building block for collision detection algorithms like
/// GJK (Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi) and EPA (Expanding Polytope Algorithm).
///
/// # What You Need to Know
///
/// If you're implementing this trait for a custom shape, you only need to implement
/// [`local_support_point`](SupportMap::local_support_point). The other methods have default
/// implementations that handle transformations and normalized directions.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// - The shape **must be convex**. Non-convex shapes will produce incorrect results.
/// - The support function should return a point on the surface of the shape (or inside it,
///   but surface points are preferred for better accuracy).
/// - For a given direction `d`, the returned point `p` should maximize `p · d` (dot product).

## v0.13.3 (08 March 2023)

### Modified

- Improved performance of intersection checks involving composite shapes (compound shapes, trimeshes, polylines, etc.)

## v0.13.2 (08 March 2023)

This version was yanked. See the release notes for 0.13.3 instead.

## v0.13.1 (26 Feb. 2023)

### Fixed

- Add workaround to address jitter issue due to incorrectly empty contact manifolds generated sometimes for convex  
  polyhedron.

## v0.13.0 (15 Jan. 2023)

### Modified

- About `rkyv` support: most POD structs (`Aabb`, `Ball`, `Cuboid`, etc.) are now archived as themselves instead of
  being archived as different types (for example `Aabb` is archived as `Aabb` itself istead of `ArchivedAabb`).

### Added

- In 3D, add `transformation::try_convex_hull` for a convex hull calculation that will return an error instead of
  panicking on unsupported inputs.

- Add `TriMesh::intersection_with_plane` for intersecting with arbitrary planes.
- Add `TriMesh::intersection_with_local_plane` for intersecting with arbitrary planes in the same space as the mesh
- Add `IntersectResult` as the output type for the above functions.
- Add `Polyline::extract_connected_components` which splits a compound polyline into its connected components.
- Add implementations of `bytemuck::Pod` and `bytemuck::Zeroable` for all the simple shapes that allow it
  (`Cuboid`, `Ball`, `Cone`, etc.), and for bounding volumes (`BoundingSphere` and `Aabb`).

## v0.12.0 (11 Dec. 2022)

- `Qbvh::leaf_data` now requires `&self` instead of `&mut self`.
- Replace the `Qbvh::leaf` boolean by a bitflags.

### Added

- Add `Qbvh::remove`, `Qbvh::pre_update_or_insert`, `Qbvh::refit`, `Qbvh::rebalance` to allow modifying a `Qbvh`
  without having to rebuild it completely.
- Add `QbvhNode::is_leaf` to get if a node is a leaf or not.
- Add `SharedShape::trimesh_with_flags` for building a trimesh with specific pre-processing flags.

- Add `SharedShape::trimesh_with_flags` for constructing a triangle mesh with flags
  specified by the user.

## v0.11.0 (30 Oct. 2022)

### Modified

- Rename `AABB` to `Aabb` to comply with Rust’s style guide.
- Rename `QBVH` to `Qbvh` to comply with Rust’s style guide.

### Added

- Add a no-std implementation of point-projection on a triangle mesh.

### Fixed

- Fix ghost collisions on internal edges on flat 3D meshed and flat 3D heightfields.
- Fix pseudo-normals calculation that could generate invalid normals for triangles with
  some small vertex angles.
- Fix `Aabb::bounding_sphere` which returned a bounding sphere that was too big.

## v0.10.0 (02 Oct. 2022)

### Modified

- Add to `query::time_of_impact` a boolean argument `stop_at_penetration`. If set to `false`
  the linear shape-cast won’t immediately stop if the shape is penetrating another shape at its
  starting point **and** its trajectory is such that it’s existing that penetration configuration.

### Added

- Add 2D `Heightfield::to_polyline` to get the explicit vertices/indices of a 2D heightfield
  seen as a polyline.
- Add the support for linear shape-cast (`query::time_of_impact`) for heightfields.
- Make the convex polyhedron scaling more forgiving regarding normals to avoid frequent unjustified panics.
- Fix panic happening when building a convex polyhedron with empty inputs.
- Add the support of Heightfields on CUDA kernels written in Rust using the `cust` crate.
- Add the `rkyv-serialize` feature that enables the implementation of `rkyv` serialization/deserialization
  for most shapes.
- Add the `parallel` feature that enables methods for the parallel traversal of Qbvh
  trees: `Qbvh::traverse_bvtt_parallel`,
  `Qbvh::traverse_bvtt_node_parallel`, `Qbvh::traverse_depth_first_parallel`, `Qbvh::traverse_depth_first_node_parallel`.

### Fixed

- Fix the application of non-uniform scaling to balls.

## v0.9.0 (30 Apr. 2022)

### Modified

- Remove `&self` argument from `Compound::decompose_trimesh`.
- Switch to `cust` 0.3 (for partial CUDA support).
- Rename `RoundShape::base_shape` to `RoundShape::inner_shape`.

### Added

- Allow custom balancing strategies for the Qbvh construction. Some strategies are allowed to generate
  new leaves during the splitting process.
- Allow using point projection on heightfields from a CUDA kernel.
- Add the simultaneous traversal of two Qbvhs.
- Add computation of `MassProperties` for a `TriMesh`.
- Add `.to_outline` methods to compute the outline of a 3D shape (useful for debug-rendering).
- Add method to apply a scaling factor to some shapes. Shapes not supporting non-uniform scaling (like balls)
  will return a convex approximation of the scaled result.
- Add methods to split (into up to two parts) a Cuboid, Segment, or TriMesh with an axis-aligned plane.
- Add the computation of the intersection mesh between two TriMesh, or between a Cuboid and a TriMesh.

## v0.8.0 (2 Jan. 2022)

### Modified

- Until now, the orientation of the polygon computed by 2D convex hull
  computation `parry2d::transformation::convex_hull` and
  `parry2d::transformation::convex_hull_idx` wasn't specified (and was generally in clockwise order). Now, this
  orientation is explicitly specified in the documentation and is set to counter-clockwise order (which is coherent
  with orientation expected by, e.g., the `ConvexPolygon` type).

### Added

- Add `parry::utils::obb` which computes a (possibly sub-optimal) OBB for a set of points.
- Add `Polyline::project_local_point_assuming_solid_interior_ccw` which projects a point on the polyline contour, and
  is able to detect if that points is located inside of the polyline, assuming that the polyline is closed and oriented
  counter-clock-wise.
- Add (3D only) `TriMesh::compute_pseudo_normals`. If this is called, and if the trimesh respects some constraints (
  oriented
  with outward normals, manifold almost everywhere, etc.) any subsequent point queries with the `solid` argument
  set to `true` will properly set the `PointProjection::is_inside` to true when the point lies in the interior of
  the trimesh.
- Added the implementation of the ear-clipping and Hertel-Mehlhorn algorithm that can be used for 2D triangulation and
  convex decomposition.
- Add the ability to use a subset of Parry’s features in a `no-std` context. If the new `cuda` cargo feature of Parry is
  enabled, all features compatible with `no-std` can be used inside of a CUDA kernel written in Rust thanks to
  the [rust-cuda](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA) ecosystem.

### Fixed

- Fix the orientation of the polygons generated by the 2D convex polygon decomposition (they are now always oriented
  counter-clockwise as expected by the `ConvexPolygon` type).
- Fix the intersection test between a 2D ball and a 2D compound shape.

## v0.7.1

### Added

- Add the method `Aabb::volume` to compute the volume of an Aabb.

## v0.7.0

### Modified

- Update the codebase to use `nalgebra v0.29`.

### Fixed

## v0.6.0

### Added

- Implement `Debug, Clone, PartialEq` for `VHACDParameters`.
- Add a method to reverse the order of a polyline.
- Add a method to remove duplicate vertices form a `TriMesh` (and adjusting the index buffer accordingly).
- Add a method to iterate through all the lean data stored by a Qbvh.
- Implement the Interval Newton Method for computing all the roots of a non-linear scalar function.
- Implement the intersection test between a spiral and an Aabb.

### Modified

- Rename all occurrences of `quadtree` to `qbvh`. Using the term `quadtree` was not representative of the actual
  acceleration structure being used (which is a BVH).

## v0.5.1

### Fixed

- Fix a bug where `query::contact` would return `None` for a all intersecting a cuboid
  in such a way that one of the cuboid's vertices coincides exactly with the ball's
  center.

### Fixed

- Fix ray-casting against solid triangles.
- Fix NaN when adding mass-properties with a zero mass.

## v0.4.2

### Added

- `ShapeType` now implements `PartialEq, Eq, Hash`.

### Fixed

- The order of vertices output by `Cuboid::to_polyline` has been modified
  to actually represent the cuboid's boundary (instead of passing through
  its diagonal).

## v0.4.1

### Added

- `SharedShape` now implements `AsRef<dyn Shape>`.
- Add the optional method `Shape::compute_swept_aabb` to the `Shape` trait.

### Modified

- Renamed `SimdQuadTree` to `Qbvh` (Quaternary Bounding Volume Hierarchy). The
  incorrect name `SimdQuadTree` is now deprecated.
- `Qbvh::clear_and_rebuild` is now slightly more general.

## v0.4.0

### Modified

- Switch to `nalgebra` 0.26.

## v0.3.0

### Added

- Add methods like `Shape::as_shape_mut` to downcast a `&mut Shape` to a concrete mutable shape.
- Add `MassProperties::set_mass` as a simple way to modify the mass while automatically adjusting
  the angular inertia.
- Make the fields of `BoundingSphere` public.
- Add `Aabb::EDGES_VERTEX_IDS` and `Aabb::FACES_VERTEX_IDS` which are index tables describing
  the vertices of a given edge, or of a given face, of the Aabb.

### Modified

- Remove the `target_dist` argument from `query::time_of_impact`.
- The `RigidBodyMotion` and all its implementors have been removed. Use the `NonlinearRigidMotion`
  struct instead.
- The `query::nonlinear_time_of_impact` function arguments changed completely to accommodate for
  the new `NonlinearRigidMotion` struct. See the doc of `query::nonlinear_time_of_impact` for details.

### Fixed

- Fix the separation computation between a cuboid and a support-map shape in the SAT implementation.
- Fix a bug causing invalid results with `query::time_of_impact` whenever the first shape was rotated.

## v0.2.0

### Added

- Add the `Shape::as_typed_shape` method to convert the shape trait-object
  to an enum.
- Add the `TypedShape` enum with variants containing references to concrete shapes
  (except for user-defined custom shapes).
- Add dedicated algorithms for the projection of a point on a cone or a cylinder.
- Improve the overall shape serialization performance.
- Add `Aabb::vertices` to get an array containing its vertices.
- Add `Aabb::split_at_center` to split an Aabb into 4 (in 2D) or 8 (in 3D) parts.
- Add `Aabb::to_trimesh` to compute the mesh representation of an Aabb.

### Removed

- Remove the `Shape::as_serialize` method.

### Fixed
